# device-independence-tripartite-q-systems
Code written during summer research project at CQT, NUS on obtaining an entanglement witness to bipartite quantum sources. A major attempt in this project was to develop modifications of the NPA hierarchy that lead to good bounds on bipartite quantum sources. The code in this repo implements the original NPA heirarchy.

The NPA hierarchy paper can be found at https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/10/7/073013/meta .
The Code uses Mosek (https://www.mosek.com/), and Yalmip (https://yalmip.github.io/), both of which can be used freely by students.
